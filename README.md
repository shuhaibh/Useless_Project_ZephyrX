### Project Description
This project creates an interactive web application that simulates cleaning the screen's interior with a fun and engaging user interface. Users can experience the satisfaction of "cleaning" the screen through visual effects and animations.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
We always take care of the outer part of our displays. The inside gets neglected. How do you tackle that persistent dirt lurking behind the glass?

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Our solution is a playful web application that allows users to ‚Äúclean‚Äù their screens using a custom sponge cursor, while also generating random dirt spots that they can erase. It‚Äôs like having a cleaning service right at your fingertips‚Äîwithout ever moving from your chair!
